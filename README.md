#Antique Shop

Are you looking to track and create orders for your very own antique shop? Well this app does just that with the ability
to track orders by date they were made and create purchase orders. 

## Installation


Retrieve the included Gemfile and Run the following command
```
bundle install
```

## Usage

To use the app run
```
ruby app.rb
```
Navigate in your browser to localhost:4567. 

Once the page has loaded you can navigate to the inventory page, showing all current inventory and also allowing new inventory
to be created. Once inventory is loaded you can mark it as being sold and it will generate an order with the amount that was 
charged and and also what was sold.
